# Huge-Fungus-Index-and-Heatmap
the end of nether tree maths

This repository houses the code used to generate the data containing the probabilities of a stem, shroomlight and wartblock generating for every block within the 7x7x27 huge fungus volume

This was an unimaginably huge project that I embarked upon around a year ago and have since put around 150 hours into theorising, mathing, coding and spreadsheeting to put this data together

I've also included a couple graphics and charts utilising this data to show it's potential in educating and informing people of the block distribution within a huge fungus, enabling them to make better farm layouts or just deepen their understanding about this fascinating area of technical minecraft
